## 🚀 Vision <a name = "vision"></a>

Tatrix's vision is to create an immersive, impartial and inclusive ecosystem for web3 gamers worldwide.

## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

1. Centralised streaming platforms exploit streamers' hard work and community influence through unfair compensation practices, lacking transparency and consensus.

2. Gamers invest significant time and money in games without receiving ownership, alignment, or governance, highlighting the absence of a GameFi streaming infrastructure for crypto and NFT payouts.

3. Transitioning from web2 game publishers' methods of acquiring and retaining users (paid ads, paid media) to a Web3 approach based on contribution (airdrops, referrals, engagement) is needed.


## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The growth of the gaming community has heightened the need for solutions to these challenges. To address this, Tatrix was conceived as a platform that combines the best aspects of entertainment, skill and decentralized finance (DeFi), bringing together gamers, GameFi projects, and guilds through streaming.

 Tatrix is a web3 Game Streaming and Community Tournament Platform that fosters a dynamic and sustainable economy for games and players. An innovative blockchain initiative that addresses the challenges faced by the GameFi sector by introducing a game live streaming platform with gated experiences, and seamless community tournament organization.
